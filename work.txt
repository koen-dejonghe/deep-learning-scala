
* python vs scala
* no deep learning frameworks for scala
* numsca
* async neural net framework with akka
  * pros:
    * monitoring & tuning of individual layers by means of messaging
    * monitoring & tuning of network by means of messaging
    * inception during training, so possibility for endless training
    * easy integration in play framework, and interaction (change hpars)
    * brain also works async
    * possibility to deploy in cluster
    * allows for easy and crazy experiments 

* courses

* Network bookkeeper
